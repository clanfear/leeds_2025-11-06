## Causation

&nbsp;


Social scientists are usually interested in causal relationships^[Even if they often pretend they are not]

* Why did $Y$ happen?
* What did $X$ do?
* How do we change $Z$?
* Did $X$ cause $Y$?

. . .

**Causal inference** is about answering these questions




## Counterfactual causality

&nbsp;

$X$ causes $Y$ if changing only $X$ would change $Y$

::: {.incremental}

This is quite broad:

* $X$ need not be the only cause of $Y$
* $X$ may cause $Y$ for multiple reasons
* $X$ ay cause $Y$ only under certain conditions

:::

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment .center}

*All that matters for the relationship to be causal is that if the distribution of $X$ was different, it would result in a different distribution of $Y$*

## Two worlds

## The treatment effect

![](img/po_treatment.svg)

## Potential outcomes

&nbsp;

We can define a causal effect as the difference ($\delta$) between two worlds or **potential outcomes**:

$$\delta = Y^1 - Y^0$$


* $Y^1$: The outcome if treated
* $Y^0$: The outcome if not treated

. . .

&nbsp;

:::{.center}

*This raises a __fundamental problem__*

:::

## World where A is treated

![](img/po_missing_1.svg)

## World where A is untreated

![](img/po_missing_2.svg)

## The fundamental problem

&nbsp;

We want to know the difference between the **factual** (what happened) and the **counterfactual** (what did not)

. . .

*This is a __missing data problem__*



. . .

::: {.incremental}

Let us assume:

* Potential outcomes are *fixed for each unit*
* Potential outcomes *vary across units*
* **Treatment** determines which potential outcome is observed

:::

. . .

We can estimate $\delta$ if we can estimate the value of the unobserved outcomes

. . .


:::{.center}

*Causal inference is largely about estimating these **counterfactuals** we cannot see*

# An example


## Clearing Lots

&nbsp;

*What is the effect of clearing vacant lots on nearby violent crime?*^[See Branas et al. (2018) *Citywide cluster randomized trial to restore blighted vacant land and its effects on violence, crime, and fear*]

::: {.fragment}
We can look at vacant lots and see what happens
:::

::: {.fragment}
But we only see one outcome per lot:

* If we clear a lot, we don't see what happens if we had not
* If we don't clear it, we don't see what happens if we had
:::

::: {.fragment}
What could we do?
:::


## Between comparison

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
We could compare different lots:

* [One cleared ($T=1$)]{.red}
* [One not cleared ($T=0$)]{.blue}

Use the difference ($\delta$) in observed crime as the causal effect

:::
::: {.column}
![](img/lots.svg)
:::
::::

&nbsp;

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

::: {.fragment}
*What if the difference is because the lots are different?*
:::

::: {.fragment}
We could look at identical looking lots
:::


:::
::: {.column}

::: {.fragment}
*But if those lots are identical, why did one get cleared and not the other?*
:::

::: {.fragment}
We can't be sure they're similar without knowing *why it got cleared*
:::

:::
::::

## A substitution


![](img/po_before-after.svg)

::: {.notes}

We taken Lot B to be a plausible substitute for Lot A's unobserved potential outcome

But Lot B may not be a good substitute!

:::

## Before and after comparison

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Could compare the same lots:

* [After clearing ($T=1$)]{.red}
* [Before clearing ($T=0$)]{.blue}

Use the before-and-after difference ($\delta$) as the causal effect

:::
::: {.column}
![](img/lot.svg)
:::
::::

&nbsp;

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

::: {.fragment}
*But what if the change was going to happen anyway?*
:::

::: {.fragment}
Maybe the crime change even caused the clearing!
:::


:::
::: {.column}

::: {.fragment}
*What if the lot was cleared **because** it would make a difference?*
:::

::: {.fragment}
Maybe there would have been no difference in other lots!
:::

:::
::::



## Different potential outcomes

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
These are really the same problem:

<br>Differences in **potential outcomes** between cleared and uncleared lots



:::
::: {.column}
![](img/potential_lots.svg)
:::
::::

&nbsp;

Put another way, the treatment effect is associated with the treatment; treated lots respond differently to treatment than untreated ones

. . .

&nbsp;

How do we make sure the cleared and uncleared lots are the same?

## Randomization

We can do this with a randomized controlled trial:

::: {.incremental}

* Take a relatively large number of lots
* Randomly pick some lots to clear
* Cleared and uncleared lots will have similar potential outcomes *on average*

:::

. . .



The probability of being treated is now independent of the outcomes:

$$(Y^0,Y^1) \perp T $$

While all the units may have different potential outcomes, the outcomes will not differ **systematically** between treatment groups

. . .

This means, essentially, we can **ignore** the treatment assignment process

## Ignorability enables substitution

![](img/po_before-after.svg)

## Average treatment effects

&nbsp;

If we randomly assign a treatment, we can estimate a causal effect as the average difference in outcomes between treated groups

This is the **average treatment effect**:

$$ATE = E[Y^1]-E[Y^0]$$



You can calculate this with a *cross-tab*^[Randomization is great if you hate doing maths]


. . .

&nbsp;

::: {.center}
*But what if we're interested in things we can't randomly assign?*
:::

## Back to counterfactuals

&nbsp;

Causal inference hinges on substituting in plausible counterfactuals in place of the potential outcomes we never observe

. . .


Substituting in counterfactuals requires knowing *why units got treated*

. . .

&nbsp;

This is the same as with randomization:

* With randomization, we *know* it happened randomly!
* Without randomization, we need to know the assignment process! 

. . .

We can again achieve ignorability **conditional** on this information about treatment assignment


## Conditional ignorability


Ignorability can be achieved if we know $Z$, which is either (or both):

* What explains differences in potential outcomes between groups
* What explains which units get treated

. . .

This requires an additional **positivity** assumption: 

*Every level of $Z$ must have a non-zero probability of receiving every treatment*

$$(Y^0,T^1) \perp T|Z,\;\; 0<Pr(T=t|Z)<1 $$

. . .


We can then calculate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE):

$$CATE=E(Y^1-Y^0|Z=z)$$

. . .

::: {.center}
*But there are some other concerns*

# The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption

## SUTVA

Must have **well-defined potential outcomes**

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment}

**Consistency:**

* No *versions* of treatment
* No *compound* treatments

:::

::: {.fragment}

**No interference:** 

* Potential outcomes depends only on the treatment the unit receives

:::

::::

:::::


## Consistency: Multiple treatments

![](img/po_consistency_1.svg)

. . .

Commonly violated in experiments *and* observational research

* Implementation differences
* Composite measures

## Consistency: Asymmetry

![](img/po_consistency_2.svg)

. . .

Nearly all studies assume symmetry—but reality is often asymmetric

* *Pulling a knife out doesn't heal the wound*
* Control conditions may be a treatment for some units

## Interference: Contamination



![](img/po_interference_1.svg)

Occurs when some units' treatments affect other units' treatments

. . .

These spillovers are common in theory and practice:

* Participants influence each other
* Micro-macro mechanisms: Norms, equilibriation

## Interference: Exploding outcomes


![](img/po_interference_2.svg)

. . .

Can often rule out in experiments, but...

* This eliminates important real mechanisms
* As a result experimental results rarely translate to large scale


## Handling issues

&nbsp;

These issues are:

* **Exceedingly common** in practice
* Sometimes, even often, **fatal to identification**


. . .


But if you're aware, they can all be addressed with:

* Careful **design**
* Clever **estimation**

. . .



# Concluding thoughts



## What is our counterfactual?

&nbsp;

Causal inference hinges on having the right counterfactual.

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment}
What if we don't know what $Y_{A}^{0}$ we want?

What if the $Y_{B}^{0}$ we have is not similar to $Y_{A}^{0}$?
:::



## Complementary frameworks

Potential outcomes is compatible with and complementary to **structural causal models**

* Structural causal models useful for thinking about:
   * Good and bad **controls**
   * Conditional **independence**
* Potential outcomes useful for thinking about:
   * Meaningful and plausible **counterfactuals**
   * Identifying **assumptions**^[E.g., [Knox et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055420000039)]


## Takeaways {.dark-slide}


**In general**

* Know and be clear about counterfactuals
* Counterfactuals come from theory, so know your theory
* Be critical consumers and reviewers
